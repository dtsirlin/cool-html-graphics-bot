# cool-html-graphics-bot
Opens a list of html files that render cool graphics in Google Chrome on loop. Go to [./html-looper](./html-looper) for this and `main.py` with your current directory being this.

Some of these html graphics allow for interaction with a mouse. Go to [./mouse-randomiser](/mouse-randomiser) for this. For macOS, you can hide cursor with https://doomlaser.com/cursorcerer-hide-your-cursor-at-will/ 

Both of these can be run at the same time. It is recommended to start mouse-randomiser first.

## Preparation
Install the following python packages before running the above scripts:
```bash
pip3 install selenium
pip3 install pyautogui
pip3 install pynput
```

> :information_source: If using Python 2.x, replace `pip3` with `pip`. If you don't have `pip`, Google how to install it.
